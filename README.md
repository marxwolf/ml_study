### Regression
use polynomial(poly_reg.py) and neural network(nn_reg.py) to regress a log function.
### Classification
#### binary classification
The code is almost identical to the code of nn_reg.py, but when do predicting, using predict_classes() method instead.
#### multi classification
This is used in multi classification, a little difference of binary classification. It uses one-hot encoding.
